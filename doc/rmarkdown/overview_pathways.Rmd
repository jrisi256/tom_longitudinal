## Sampling Strategy

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/sampling.html)
* Maricopa County, AZ and Philadelphia, PA.
* At least 14 years old but under the age of 18 at the time the offense was committed.
* Only serious offenses (mostly felonies with some misdemeanor property, sexual assault, and weapons offenses).
* Provided informed assent or consent (parental consent for all those under the age of 18 at time of enrollment).
* Proportion of male youth found guilty of a drug charge was capped at 15% to avoid over-representation.
* Court files in each locale were reviewed to determine potential study participants.
* The majority of interviews took place in the subject's home or in their residential placement facility. Sometimes the interviews were done at someone else's home, over the phone, in a researcher's office, or in a public place.
* ![Interview location percentages](../img/interview_locations.png)
* All females as well as all youth being considered for trial in the adult system (who met age and crime criteria) were approached for enrollment.
* 20% of youth approached for participation declined.

## Data Collection

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/datacollectionprocedures.html).
* Baseline Interview (First baseline interview completed in November 2000, last one completed in March 2003).
* Follow-up Interviews at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 months past baseline (first follow up interview was May 2001 and last was March 2010). Basically every 6 months for the first 3 years and then annually thereafter. Participants were contacted every 3 to 6 months over the entire course of the study to provide updated contact information.
* Data were collected with computer-assisted interviews which took place in participants' homes, libraries, other public places, or in facilities. Trained interviewers read each item aloud and respondents were allowed to enter their responses on a key pad (to maximize privacy).
* Self-report information is supplemented and validated through interviews with collateral reporters and using official record information (FBI arrest records and juvenile/adult court records from each jurisdiction).

### Baseline Interview

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/baselineinterview.html).
* Conducted within 75 days of adjudication (juvenile system) or within 90 days of decertification hearing in Philadelphia or adult arraignment in Arizona.
* **Background characteristics** (e.g. demographics, offense history, academic achievement), **individual functioning** (e.g. work and school performance, substance abuse), **psychosocial development and attitudes** (e.g. impulse control, susceptibility to peer influence),  **family context** (e.g. household composition), **personal relationships** (e.g. quality of romantic relationships and friends, peer delinquency, contacts with caring adults), **community context** (e.g. neighborhood conditions, personal capital, social ties).
* Conducted in two 2-hour sessions.
* [Link to word document with an overview of each variable categories collected during the baseline interview](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/documents/baselineReferenceList.doc).

### Follow-up Interviews

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/followupinterview.html).
* Took approximately 2 hours.
* Study participants were paid using a graduated payment schedule ranging from \$50 to \$115.
* A **window of opportunity** opened 6 weeks prior to the follow-up interview target date and closed 8 weeks after the target date. If the follow-up interview couldn't be completed within this time frame, it was considered a missed interview.
* ![Retention rates for the study](../img/retention_rates.png)
* Similar to the baseline interview, questions were asked about **individual functioning**, **psychosocial development and attitudes**, **family context**, **personal relationships**, and **community context**.
    * An additional subset of questions were asked concerning a monthly account of changes in the participant's life.
    * These monthly changes were captured using **life-event calendars**. The premise being that juvenile offenders have chaotic and unstable lives. Life-event calendars are meant to capture the nature, number, and timing of important changes in life circumstances. E.g. interview captures if the participant worked during a specific interview period, but life-event calendars capture when and how long such employment periods last (and then if such periods precede or follow criminal activity). Life-event calendar information is collected at the monthly level for **education**, **income-generating activities**, **contact with legal system**, **living situation**, **romantic relationships**, and **sanctions and interventions**.

### Collateral Interviews

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/collateralinterviews.html)
* Provided in the link are the completion rates as well as the rates of types of collateral informants.
* Interviews with collateral informants (e.g. parent, family member, or friend) were completed at the time of the baseline interview and annually for the first three years of follow-up.
    * At baseline, the collateral informant was usually a parent (to provide rich background on the subject).
    * At follow-up, the collateral informant was usually a peer (to provide accurate information about deviant behavior).

### Release Interviews

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/releaseinterviews.html)
* Study subjects completed a release interview at the time they exited a residential setting of any kind. The goal was to obtain the subject's views on the residential experience and institutional environment.
* They were completed within 30 days prior to or after release from a facility. The short time frame was meant to capture the subject's views as soon as they were released as possible (to ensure intervening events didn't unduly influence their perceptions).
* Interview was conducted in a separate session from the regular interviews so as to not unduly strain the subject.
* Only have release interviews for 54% of the sample which experienced a residential stay.

### Official Record Information

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/officialrecordinformation.html)
* When possible, official administrative records were used to verify the accounts from the interviews with the subjects.
* Sources used include: **juvenile and adult court records** (arrests and court appearances subsequent to study enrollment), **FBI records** (arrests which occurred outside of the county jurisdiction), **court service records** (specifics of service provision ordered by court), **Medicaid claims data** (services received outside the purview of the courts like therapy), **Child protective services** (any prior contact enrolled subjects had with the child welfare system).

## Data Documentation

* [Data constructs](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/constructs.html). This links to the high-level overview of what constructs were measured in this survey.
* [Data measures](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/measures.html). I find this link more useful than the constructs page. This contains more granular information about the categories of questions asked and when they were asked (baseline, follow-up, release, collateral baseline, collateral follow-up).
* [Data calendars](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/calendars.html).
    * What are data calendars? How are they different from the other self-reported measures? Well they're actually called monthly-life approach calendars. Research participants are provided with a visual calendar, and then they're asked to recall salient life events while marking them on the calendar. These important life events provide an anchor for participants to recall pertinent events for the purposes of the survey. It draws upon scientific research about how people remember events and life situations. From a practical perspective, it provides a richer set of data points. Instead of simply getting a summary measure of life changes over an extended recall period, the monthly life-calendar places these changes within specific points in time opening up all new possibilities of research (examining sequences of events and causal mechanisms).
    * This data is only available for restricted use.
    * [Antisocial activities](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/cal-sro_calendar_codebook.html). Lines up with self-reported offending.
    * [Contacts with the justice system](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/cal-cjs_codebook.html).
    * [Court monitoring](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/cal-court_monitoring_services_codebook.html).
    * [Out of community placements](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/cal-out_of_community_placements_codebook.html).
* [Official Records](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/official-record-information.html). For our interests, this tracks whether or not a participant has an official arrest record before the baseline interview as well as in the interim time periods between each follow-up interview. The questions aren't as finely grained as the self-report variables. The data is also restricted use. Plans are being made to provide data from drug screenings.
