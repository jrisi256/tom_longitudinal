## Sampling Strategy

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/sampling.html)
* Maricopa County, AZ and Philadelphia, PA.
* At least 14 years old but under the age of 18 at the time the offense was committed.
* Only serious offenses (mostly felonies with some misdemeanor property, sexual assault, and weapons offenses).
* Provided informed assent or consent (parental consent for all those under the age of 18 at time of enrollment).
* Proportion of male youth found guilty of a drug charge was capped at 15% to avoid over-representation.
* Court files in each locale were reviewed to determine potential study participants.
* The majority of interviews took place in the subject's home or in their residential placement facility. Sometimes the interviews were done at someone else's home, over the phone, in a researcher's office, or in a public place.
* ![Interview location percentages](interview_locations.png)
* All females as well as all youth being considered for trial in the adult system (who met age and crime criteria) were approached for enrollment.
* 20% of youth approached for participation declined.

## Data Collection

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/datacollectionprocedures.html).
* Baseline Interview (First baseline interview completed in November 2000, last one completed in March 2003).
* Follow-up Interviews at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 months past baseline (first follow up interview was May 2001 and last was March 2010). Basically every 6 months for the first 3 years and then annually thereafter. Participants were contacted every 3 to 6 months over the entire course of the study to provide updated contact information.
* Data were collected with computer-assisted interviews which took place in participants' homes, libraries, other public places, or in facilities. Trained interviewers read each item aloud and respondents were allowed to enter their responses on a key pad (to maximize privacy).
* Self-report information is supplemented and validated through interviews with collateral reporters and using official record information (FBI arrest records and juvenile/adult court records from each jurisdiction).

### Baseline Interview

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/baselineinterview.html).
* Conducted within 75 days of adjudication (juvenile system) or within 90 days of decertification hearing in Philadelphia or adult arraignment in Arizona.
* **Background characteristics** (e.g. demographics, offense history, academic achievement), **individual functioning** (e.g. work and school performance, substance abuse), **psychosocial development and attitudes** (e.g. impulse control, susceptibility to peer influence),  **family context** (e.g. household composition), **personal relationships** (e.g. quality of romantic relationships and friends, peer delinquency, contacts with caring adults), **community context** (e.g. neighborhood conditions, personal capital, social ties).
* Conducted in two 2-hour sessions.

### Follow-up Interviews

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/followupinterview.html).
* Took approximately 2 hours.
* Study participants were paid using a graduated payment schedule ranging from \$50 to \$115.
* A **window of opportunity** opened 6 weeks prior to the follow-up interview target date and closed 8 weeks after the target date. If the follow-up interview couldn't be completed within this time frame, it was considered a missed interview.
* ![Retention rates for the study](retention_rates.png)
* Similar to the baseline interview, questions were asked about **individual functioning**, **psychosocial development and attitudes**, **family context**, **personal relationships**, and **community context**.
    * An additional subset of questions were asked concerning a monthly account of changes in the participant's life.
    * These monthly changes were captured using **life-event calendars**. The premise being that juvenile offenders have chaotic and unstable lives. Life-event calendars are meant to capture the nature, number, and timing of important changes in life circumstances. E.g. interview captures if the participant worked during a specific interview period, but life-event calendars capture when and how long such employment periods last (and then if such periods precede or follow criminal activity). Life-event calendar information is collected at the monthly level for **education**, **income-generating activities**, **contact with legal system**, **living situation**, **romantic relationships**, and **sanctions and interventions**.

### Collateral Interviews

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/collateralinterviews.html)
* Provided in the link are the completion rates as well as the rates of types of collateral informants.
* Interviews with collateral informants (e.g. parent, family member, or friend) were completed at the time of the baseline interview and annually for the first three years of follow-up.
    * At baseline, the collateral informant was usually a parent (to provide rich background on the subject).
    * At follow-up, the collateral informant was usually a peer (to provide accurate information about deviant behavior).

### Release Interviews

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/releaseinterviews.html)
* Study subjects completed a release interview at the time they exited a residential setting of any kind. The goal was to obtain the subject's views on the residential experience and institutional environment.
* They were completed within 30 days prior to or after release from a facility. The short time frame was meant to capture the subject's views as soon as they were released as possible (to ensure intervening events didn't unduly influence their perceptions).
* Interview was conducted in a separate session from the regular interviews so as to not unduly strain the subject.
* Only have release interviews for 54% of the sample which experienced a residential stay.

### Official Record Information

* [Link](https://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/officialrecordinformation.html)
* When possible, official administrative records were used to verify the accounts from the interviews with the subjects.
* Sources used include: **juvenile and adult court records** (arrests and court appearances subsequent to study enrollment), **FBI records** (arrests which occurred outside of the county jurisdiction), **court service records** (specifics of service provision ordered by court), **Medicaid claims data** (services received outside the purview of the courts like therapy), **Child protective services** (any prior contact enrolled subjects had with the child welfare system).
